I am a faculty member in the Department of [Computer Engineering](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/) at [Boğaziçi University](https://bogazici.edu.tr/en_US). Prior to joining the Computer Engineering Department, I worked as a research assistant and received by Ph.D. degree in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.msu.edu/about/departments/cse) at Michigan State University under the supervision of [Anil K. Jain](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~jain/) and [Jiayu Zhou](https://jiayuzhou.github.io/).

My research interests include machine learning, deep learning, adversarial robustness, temporal analysis, and their applications in biomedical informatics.
